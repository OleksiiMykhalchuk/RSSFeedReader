Two major sticking points are that the app makes use of an API that we leverage from a 3rd party, and that the app is used to purchase Bitcoin. The automatic review process is rejecting the app based on these criteria and we have been stuck in this position for near 2 months. <br /><br />
We require an expert in iOS app submissions and the review process to guide and manage the submission process to ensure that our app gets listed on the App Store. We currently have a Android app that is live in the market. <br /><br />
The app is very simple, it acquires funds from the users linked bank account (across an EFT rail) and transfers this into a digital wallet (held with an accountable, regulated institution). These funds are used to purchase Bitcoin for the user on a weekly basis. The Bitcoin is purchased from a local South African exchange, where it is held in custody for the user. The 3rd party API belongs to the regulated institution who has the integration to the Bitcoin exchange as well as the digital wallet where the fiat funds are held.<br /><br />
